Daily vs Monthly Payment observations:
The "race" results to see which payment method, daily versus monthly, differs based on what day of the month you start your daily payments.
For example if the monthly payment were to have automatically withdrawn from your account on the 26th of the month, and you start daily payments on the 24th, then the total amount put towards your loans that month is a lot lower than if you were to just have done the monthly payment. This is because there may only be 4 days remaining in the month, and four multiplied by your daily payment is much less than your montly payment.
