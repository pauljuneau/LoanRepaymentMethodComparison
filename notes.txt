--Test values:
loan amount: 13400
day: 01/31/2016
Payment date: 26
APR: 7.99
Time duration: 100 years <-- built in time span.

--What is currently functional
Session storage works well to temporarily store variables. The variables will clear once the page is refreshed. 

Function, timeSpanGenerator, generates a time span of 100 years starting form the current loan date entered by the user.

Mathematical function for principal daily and monthly is correct.

--What needs to be done:
+Something is wrong with do.. while loop in loanCalc function. Need to work on algorithm. 
The loop increments possibly one to many and .split tries to execute on t[count = x] = null. 

+Determine the mathematical function for compounding interest:
let loan amount = P (for principal)

P(t) = P(t-1) + P(t-1)*DPR
